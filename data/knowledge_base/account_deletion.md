# Account Deletion

## Overview

We respect your right to privacy and understand that you may wish to delete your account. This guide explains the account deletion process, what happens to your data, and how to request account deletion.

## Before You Delete Your Account

Before proceeding with account deletion, please consider the following:

- All your data will be permanently deleted and cannot be recovered
- Any active subscriptions will be cancelled immediately
- You will lose access to all purchased content and services
- Any remaining account credits will be forfeited

We recommend downloading any important data or content before initiating the deletion process.

## How to Delete Your Account

2. Navigate to "Account Settings"
3. Scroll to the "Danger Zone" section at the bottom
4. Click on "Delete Account"
5. Enter your password to confirm
6. Click "Confirm Deletion"

Your account will be scheduled for deletion within 24 hours. You will receive a confirmation email at your registered email address.

1. Contact support at support@example.com
2. Include your account email address
3. Request account deletion
4. Our team will process your request within 3-5 business days

For security purposes, we may require additional verification before processing the deletion request.

## Data Retention Policy

After your account is deleted:

- Personal information (name, email, address) is permanently deleted within 30 days
- Account activity logs are retained for 90 days for security purposes
- Transaction records are retained for 7 years as required by financial regulations
- Any content you created that is publicly available may remain accessible

## Reversing Account Deletion

Once the deletion process is complete, account deletion cannot be reversed. If you change your mind before the 24-hour processing period is complete, please contact our support team immediately at support@example.com with the subject line "URGENT: Cancel Account Deletion."

## Data Export

Before deleting your account, you may request a complete export of your data:

1. Go to "Account Settings"
2. Click on "Export Data"
3. Select the data types you wish to export
4. Click "Request Export"
5. You will receive an email with a download link within 24 hours

The export will include all your personal information, purchase history, and any content you have created.

## Third-Party Integrations

If you have connected third-party services to your account, we recommend disconnecting these integrations before deleting your account:

1. Go to "Account Settings"
2. Navigate to "Integrations"
3. Click "Disconnect" next to each connected service
4. Confirm the disconnection

This ensures that third-party services no longer have access to your account data.

## Legal Requirements

In certain jurisdictions, we may be required to retain some data for legal or regulatory purposes even after account deletion. This includes:

- Fraud prevention records
- Anti-money laundering compliance data
- Legal investigation records

These records are retained only as long as legally required and are not used for any other purpose.
