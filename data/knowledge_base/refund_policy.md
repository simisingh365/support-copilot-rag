# Refund Policy

## Overview

Our company offers a comprehensive refund policy to ensure customer satisfaction. We understand that sometimes products or services may not meet your expectations, and we are committed to making the refund process as smooth as possible.

## Standard Refund Window

All purchases are eligible for a full refund within 30 days of the original purchase date. This applies to both physical products and digital services. After the 30-day period, refunds may still be available under certain circumstances, but will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

## Refund Process

To request a refund, please follow these steps:

1. Log into your account and navigate to the "My Orders" section
2. Select the order you wish to refund
3. Click on the "Request Refund" button
4. Provide a reason for the refund request
5. Submit your request

Our support team will review your request within 2-3 business days. You will receive an email notification once a decision has been made.

## Refund Methods

Refunds are processed back to the original payment method used for the purchase. If the original payment method is no longer available, we may offer store credit or an alternative refund method.

- Credit card refunds typically take 5-7 business days to appear on your statement
- PayPal refunds are usually processed within 3-5 business days
- Bank transfers may take up to 10 business days

## Exceptions

Certain items are not eligible for refunds:

- Downloaded digital content that has been accessed
- Customized or personalized products
- Perishable items
- Gift cards

## Partial Refunds

For orders containing multiple items, you may request a partial refund for specific items. The refund amount will be prorated based on the original purchase price of the returned items.

## Shipping Costs

If you are returning a physical product due to a defect or error on our part, we will cover the return shipping costs. For returns due to personal preference or change of mind, you are responsible for return shipping fees.
